## Overview

This project is a 2D platformer developed in Godot 4 as part of my CSC capstone project. The core concept centers around controlling two characters simultaneously, each with inverted and/or delayed movement, creating a unique coordination-based gameplay experience.

The game challenges players to think differently about movement, timing, and spatial awareness while navigating platforming levels designed around these mechanics.

- Dual-character control

- Inverted movement mechanics

- Delayed input on secondary character
